## What is HTTP?

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** is a protocol used for transferring data over the web. It operates at the application layer of the OSI model. HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands.


***HTTP*** *is a [protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Protocol) for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is typically constructed from resources such as text content, layout instructions, images, videos, scripts, and more.*
