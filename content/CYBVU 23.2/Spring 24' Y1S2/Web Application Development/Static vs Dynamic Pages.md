## Static vs Dynamic Pages

**Static Pages**: Static web pages have fixed content that remains the same for every visitor. They are created using HTML and CSS, and any updates to the content require manually editing the HTML files. Because they don’t involve server-side processing, static pages usually load faster and are simpler to develop. Examples include personal portfolios or basic informational sites.
  
**Dynamic Pages**: Dynamic web pages can change their content based on user interactions or other factors. They use server-side technologies like PHP, Python, or JavaScript (Node.js) to generate content in real-time. This allows for a personalized experience and higher interactivity, such as on e-commerce sites or social media platforms. Updating dynamic pages often involves working with databases and content management systems, which adds complexity but also flexibility.

| Aspect               | Static Pages                                        | Dynamic Pages                                      |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | Fixed content that doesn’t change unless manually updated. | Content that can change based on user interaction or other factors. |
| **Content**          | Same for every visitor.                             | Can vary for each visitor or session.             |
| **Technology**       | HTML, CSS.                                           | HTML, CSS, and server-side languages like PHP, Python, or JavaScript (Node.js). |
| **Performance**      | Generally faster to load as they are pre-rendered.  | May be slower due to server-side processing.       |
| **Interactivity**    | Limited interactivity; requires manual updates.     | High interactivity; content can be customized in real-time. |
| **Development**      | Simpler to create; no need for server-side processing. | More complex; requires backend programming and a database. |
| **Examples**         | Personal portfolios, basic informational sites.     | E-commerce sites, social media platforms, user dashboards. |
| **Updates**          | Changes require direct editing of HTML files.       | Changes can be made through content management systems or databases. |
