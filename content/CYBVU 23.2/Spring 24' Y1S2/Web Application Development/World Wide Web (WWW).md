## What is WWW?

The **World Wide Web (WWW)** is a system of interlinked hypertext documents and multimedia content accessed via the internet. It was invented by *Tim Berners-Lee* in 1989 and allows users to navigate through websites using hyperlinks, which are accessed through web browsers. The WWW uses protocols like HTTP/HTTPS for communication, and web pages are typically written in HTML. It revolutionized the way information is shared and accessed globally, making the internet accessible to the general public.
