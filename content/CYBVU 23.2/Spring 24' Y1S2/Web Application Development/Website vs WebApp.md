## Website vs WebApp

**Websites** are typically designed to provide information and content to users in a straightforward, read-only format. They often include static or dynamic web pages that users can navigate to access articles, news, company details, and other content. The primary goal of a website is to present information in a user-friendly manner, and interaction is generally limited to browsing and reading content.

**Web applications**, in contrast, are built to offer interactive functionalities and perform specific tasks for users. They often involve complex user interactions and backend processing, such as handling form submissions, managing user accounts, or executing transactions. Web applications are designed to provide a dynamic and functional experience, with features that change based on user input and require a higher level of interactivity and data management.
