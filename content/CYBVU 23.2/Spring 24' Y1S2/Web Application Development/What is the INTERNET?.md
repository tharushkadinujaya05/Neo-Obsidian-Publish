## What is INTERNET?
The internet is a global network of interconnected computer networks that enables communication and data transfer using standardized ***protocols***.. *The internet is the largest computer network in the world that have more than a billion computer users*

What are ***PROTOCOLS?***

Internet protocols are like the *rules and agreements* that computers use to communicate with each other over the internet. They define how data is *formatted, sent, and received,* ensuring everything works smoothly. Think of them as the *language computers speak* to understand each other.

## Web Browser in a Nutshell:

A web browser is like a translator for the internet. It takes **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** code (the languages of the web) and turns it into the **websites** you see and interact with.

#### Key components:

* **Rendering engine:** Interprets code and displays content.
* **Networking:** Connects to servers and fetches data.
* **User interface:** Provides controls for navigation, browsing, and interaction.
* **Security:** Protects you from malicious websites and code.

#### Popular browsers

* **Arc**,**Chrome**, **Firefox**, **Safari**, **Edge**, **Opera**

#### How it works
***CLIENT-SERVER MODEL***
![[Assets/Screen Recording Sep 01 1.gif]]
1. You type in a website address (URL).
2. The browser sends a request to the server hosting the website.
3. The server sends back the website's code. ***(HTTP/HTTPS)***
4. The browser renders the code into the website you see.
5. You interact with the website using the browser's interface.

**In short:** A web browser is your window to the internet, allowing you to access and interact with the vast world of web content.
