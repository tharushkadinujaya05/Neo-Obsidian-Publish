### Guided Medium to Unguided Medium
- **Mobility:** The rise of mobile devices created a demand for wireless connectivity. (Early devices were fixed components)
- Electromagnetic Waves were used as the carrier to transmit data through the environment.
- **Benefits of Wireless:**
    - High speed.
    - Good penetration through obstacles. 
    - Wide accessibility.    
    - Cost-effectiveness.

### Types of Wireless Data Transmission and Technologies

- **List of Technologies:**
    - Radio Frequency (RF) Transmission
    - Microwave Transmission
    - Infrared Transmission
    - Lightwave Transmission

### Radio Frequency Transmission
- **Key Points:**
    - **EM Waves:** RF signals are electromagnetic waves.
    - **Frequency Range:** Typically 3 kHz to 300 GHz.
    - **Advantages:**
        - Can penetrate obstacles and travel long distances.
        - Relatively inexpensive to generate and transmit.
	- - **Short and Long Range:** Radio communication is used for both short-range (walkie-talkies) and long-range (AM/FM radio) communication.

### Microwave Transmission
- **Key Points:**
    - **Frequency Range:** 300 MHz to 300 GHz.
    - **Applications:** Short and long-range communications, satellite communication, terrestrial microwave links.
    - **Advantages:**
        - Relatively inexpensive.    
        - High bandwidth.
     - **Types:**
	    - **Satellite Transmission (SMTS):** Uses satellites to relay signals over long distances.
	    - **Terrestrial Microwave Transmission System (TMTS):** Uses ground-based towers to relay signals.

#### Terrestrial Microwave Transmission System (TMTS)
- **Line-of-Sight:** Requires a clear path between towers, as signals cannot penetrate obstacles well.
- **Directional Antennas:** Use parabolic antennas to focus signals.
- **Frequency and Speed:** Typically uses frequencies in the lower GHz range (4-6 GHz or 21-23 GHz) and speeds of 1 Mbps to 10 Mbps.

#### Satelite Microwave Transmission System (SMTS)
![[Assets/Pasted image 20241009015023.png]]
- **How It Works:** Satellites in orbit relay signals between ground stations.
- **Process:**
    - **Uplink:** Signals are transmitted from a ground station to the satellite.
    - **Downlink:** The satellite amplifies the signal and transmits it back to another ground station.

### Satellite Communication
- **Components:**
    - **Space Segment:** The satellites orbiting Earth.
    - **Ground Segment:** Earth-based transmission and receiving stations.
- **Applications:**
    - Television distribution, long-distance telephone calls, private business networks, GPS, internet services, satellite phones.

####  Characteristics of Satellite Technology
- **Advantages:** Covers the benefits of using satellite communication.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - **Limited Repair:** Difficult and expensive to repair satellites once they are in orbit.
    - **Delay:** High latency (delay) due to the long distance signals travel.
    - **Attenuation:** Signal strength decreases over long distances.    
    - **Mostly One-Way:** Primarily used for one-way communication (e.g., satellite TV or radio).
        
- **Best Use Cases:**
    - Connecting very remote locations.
    - Emergency and secure communication (military, rescue).

###  Infrared Transmission
- **Key Points:**
    - **EM Waves:** Infrared radiation is part of the electromagnetic spectrum with longer wavelengths than visible light.
    - **Short Range:** Used for short-distance communication.
    - **Line-of-Sight:** Usually requires a clear line of sight between the transmitter and receiver, as IR signals don't penetrate solid objects well.
        
- **Types:**
    - **Point-to-Point:** Direct communication between two devices.
    - **Diffuse Point:** A broadcast system where signals are reflected off surfaces to reach multiple devices.
- **Components:**
    
    - **Transmitter:** Photo LED (light-emitting diode).
        
    - **Receiver:** Photodiode.
        
- **How it Works:** The LED emits modulated light that is captured by the photodiode.
- **Applications:** Mobile phones, TVs, security systems, laptops, remote controls.

### Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)
- **History:** Introduced in the late 1990s, based on IEEE 802.11 standards.
- **Applications:** LANs, internet access, short-to-medium-range communication.
- **Components:** Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) and Stations (devices connected to the network).
- **Frequencies:** Uses 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz.

### Cellular Technology

### GSM
- Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM)
- **Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA):** A technique for sharing the radio spectrum.
- **SIM Card:** A removable card that stores subscriber information and authentication keys.

### GRPS (2.5G)
- **Packet Switching:** Allows for more efficient data transmission.
- **Data Capability:** Enabled mobile internet access (email, basic web browsing), though speeds were still limited.

### Summary 
- Connection media are essential for data communication.
- Different connection technologies have their own advantages and limitations.
- Factors like speed, capacity, cost, and environmental conditions affect the choice of technology.
