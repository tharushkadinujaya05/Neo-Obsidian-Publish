### Email?
- **Main Point:** Introduces email as a non-real-time but reliable network application.
	1. **Server Processing**: When you send an email, it goes through several servers (e.g., your email server, the recipient’s email server) before reaching the recipient. This process can take a few seconds to minutes.

	2. **No Immediate Notifications**: The recipient might not check or receive the email right away, as email clients usually check for new messages at intervals, not continuously.
	
	3. **Not Designed for Instant Replies**: Email is designed for messages that don’t need immediate responses. This makes it different from real-time platforms like chat apps, which expect quick back-and-forth communication.
- **Types:** Webmail services (e.g., Gmail, Outlook), email clients (e.g., Outlook Express).

- **@ Symbol:** The ubiquitous symbol was used to separate the user name from the domain.
- During the 1980s and 1990s, use of email became common in business, government, universities and military industries

### Mail Components in an E-mail
- **Key Components:**
    
    - **Mail Accounts:** Uniquely identify mailboxes (e.g., [user@domain.com](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=mailto%3Auser%40domain.com)).
    - **Mail Clients (User Agent):** Software that allows users to send and receive email (e.g., Outlook Express).
        
    - **Mail Servers:** Provide email services:
        - **MTA (Mail Transfer Agent):** Handles sending and receiving email.    
        - **MDA (Mail Delivery Agent):** Delivers incoming email to the user's mailbox.          
        - **MSA (Mail Submission Agent):** Handles outgoing emails.            
        - **Mail Directory Servers:** Used for managing email addresses and domains.         
        - **Webmail Servers:** Provide a web-based interface for email.        
        - **Spam Filters and Virus Guards:** Protect against unwanted emails and malware.
            
    - **Mail Exchange Protocols:** 
        - **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Used for sending emails.    
        - **POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3):** Used to download emails to a client.        
        - **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):** Used to access emails on a server without downloading them.
