Welcome to my personal collection of notes, resources! I've uploaded all the notes I've noted down so far (NOTE : these are my own notes, not the ones from lectures cause I ain't always hitting up class, lol).

Feel free to dive into the various sections, explore different topics, and use these notes as a springboard for your own studies. Whether youâ€™re here to find that one key piece of info or just want to see how someone else is organizing their thoughts, I hope you find this space useful.

## ðŸ”¥ Quick Access to Exam Notes:

#### Y1S2
[[ðŸ”— Web Application Development - CYBVU 23.2]]
[[ðŸ”— Operating Systems]]

> [!NOTE] NOTE
> For now, Iâ€™ve only covered the topics above. Iâ€™ll drop future notes as I finish â€˜em!

## How to Use This Site

To navigate through the notes:

1. **Year One Semester Notes**: 
   - Go to the **Y1S2** folder for notes from the second semester of Year One.
   - Inside the relevant module folder, look for files labeled with a ðŸ”— emoji. This emoji signifies the index file containing the structured notes for that module.

2. **Navigating the Index Files**:
   - Click on the file with the ðŸ”— emoji to access the index file. From there, you'll be able to navigate through the structured notes.

Feel free to explore the folders and files to find the information you need. If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out!

Enjoy browsing through the notes!
